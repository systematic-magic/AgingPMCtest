2.4. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)

	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Please notify production team if you notice that an initial is being used for an author’s first name. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`

If there is only one affiliation text for all authors, then each author name should have “1” next to it.

For example, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4 is OK. Sometimes callouts can appear to be out of linear order due to being called out in tables - This is OK as long as all other callouts are following linear order.

	If one or more references or callouts are missing or are being called out of linear order in the text, please notify production team.

10.5.3. Check for references containing journal title in English and original language (e.g. "International journal of cancer" and "Journal international du cancer"). Remove title in original language and leave English version. If there is just a "foreign language" version present, it is OK to leave that version (no need to find English one). Consult `PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ if in doubt of the correct journal name.
