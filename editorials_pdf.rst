	- Check that there is a space after comma (,) and no space before and after en dash (–).

	- Check that reference callouts are in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and are not hyperlinked.

3.2. Check that callout number for each of the references is present in the text or is covered in the range of numbers. i.e. in the range of [1–3] reference 2 is not present in the text, but covered in the range. This case is acceptable. |br|
Callouts can be found in text and figures.

3.3. Check that there are no callouts for non-existing references (i.e. there is a callout, but there is no reference).

3.4. Check that there are no references for which callouts are missing (i.e. there is a reference, but there is no callout for it).

3.5. Check that reference callouts appear in linear order throughout the manuscript. 1, 2, 3 and so on. Once a reference has initially been called out, it can be called out again in any order. For example, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4 is OK.

	If one or more references or callouts are missing or are being called out of linear order in the text, please notify production team.
