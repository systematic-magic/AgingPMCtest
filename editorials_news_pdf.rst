2. Author list
--------------

.. Note::
	
	The number of authors is limited to three for editorials. |br|

2.1. Check that author list contains full names of authors divided by comma (,). If there are only 2 authors, then check that they are divided by "and" word.

2.2. Check that author names are formatted in black and bold font.

2.3. Check that there is no punctuation mark at the end of author list.

2.4. Check that author names do not have affiliation numbers.

2.5. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName MN. LastName` (MN. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.

2.6. Check that there are no affiliations listed for authors (there must be no affiliations on the page).

3. Reference Callouts
---------------------

3.1. Check reference callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of reference callouts:

	| :sample:`[N]` (where “N” is the order number of the corresponding reference)
	|
	| `Examples:`
	| :sample:`[1]`
	| :sample:`[1, 2]`
	| :sample:`[1–3]`
	| :sample:`[1, 3–4]`

.. image:: /_static/pdf_editorials_reference_callouts.png
   :alt: Reference callouts
   :scale: 99%
|
	- Check that only comma (,) and :ref:`en dash<en_dash>` (–) are used as a separators. No other separators are allowed. 

	- Check that there is a space after comma (,) and no space before and after en dash (–).

	- Check that reference callouts are in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and are not hyperlinked.

3.2. Check that callout number for each of the references is present in the text or is covered in the range of numbers. i.e. in the range of [1-3] reference 2 is not present in the text, but covered in the range. This case is acceptable. |br|
Callouts can be found in text and figures.

3.3. Check that there are no callouts for non-existing references (i.e. there is a callout, but there is no reference).

3.4. Check that there are no references for which callouts are missing (i.e. there is a reference, but there is no callout for it).

3.5. Check that reference callouts appear in linear order throughout the manuscript. 1, 2, 3 and so on. Once a reference has initially been called out, it can be called out again in any order. For example, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4 is OK.

	If one or more references or callouts are missing or are being called out of linear order in the text, please contact author.
